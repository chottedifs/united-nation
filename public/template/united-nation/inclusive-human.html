                        The convergence of Indonesia’s high informal labour rate, its geographically diffuse population, and the unequal socio-economic burdens imposed by COVID-19 heightened the risk of people falling through the social safety net in 2021. <br> <br>
                        Universal health coverage is key to shoring up that net and the UN has supported the expansion of Indonesia’s national health insurance program since its rollout in 2014. By 2021 the insurance scheme covered 86.96% of the population, up from 82.07% in 2020. The UN helped more than 3.3 million children receive unconditional child benefits in 2021, while 35.9 million people indirectly benefit from UN support to strengthen social protection programmes. <br><br>
                        Food supply chain disruptions and the loss of income during COVID-19 contributed to an increase   in   undernourishment   in   Indonesia, which afflicted 8.34% of the population in 2020, up from 7.63% in 2019, according to Indonesia’s 2021 Voluntary National Review. Among other initiatives, the UN provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture that resulted in the finalisation of one national and five provincial Food Security and Vulnerability Atlases, which informed   several   country-wide   programmes to tackle food insecurity and reduce childhood stunting. Meanwhile, almost 5,000 health service providers received UN training on the integrated management of acute malnutrition.  <br><br>
                        The COVID-19 pandemic pushed Indonesia’s healthcare system to the brink in 2021, which not only taxed the country’s ability to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus but also its ability to cope with an array of contemporary health challenges. UN interventions helped the system continue to function under unprecedented stress. The World Health Organization alone supported 39 activities to strengthen Indonesia’s healthcare capacity, across technology, policy, and human resources. For example, the UN trained more than 183,000 health workers on surveillance, rapid response, and psychosocial support in relation to the detection, referral and management of COVID-19 cases. UN training helped a further 4,312 health workers enhance their knowledge of pharmacology and pharmacovigilance in relation to COVID-19 preparedness and response efforts; more than 10,000 primary care workers received extra training on HIV testing and treatment. <br><br>

                        Despite considerable progress over the past decade, Indonesia’s maternal mortality ratio remains high with some 177 deaths occurring for every 100,000 live births, compared with a regional average of 152 per 100,000 live births. <br><br>
                        In 2021, UN support for Government efforts to deliver better   maternal   and   new-born   health included the provision of technical assistance for new guidelines on maternal and perinatal death surveillance, and specific assistance to improve the care of vulnerable infants, including infants with low birth weight, those with possible serious bacterial infections, and those born to HIV-positive mothers. UN support to strengthen maternal health services benefitted more than 5.7 million people. <br><br>
                        A further 232,000 people directly benefited from Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) interventions as part of the UN’s COVID-19 prevention and response efforts. Meanwhile, a UN pilot water safety programme provided more than 1 million people with improved access to clean water, while UN initiatives to promote open-defecation free villages reduced disease risk for some 100,000 people in rural areas. <br><br>
                        The COVID-19 pandemic caused the world’s largest-ever recorded disruption in education. To mitigate this disruption, in 2021 the UN helped approximately 5.7 million Indonesian students at over 37,000 schools safely resume face-to-face learning in accordance with COVID-19 health protocols. UN support for child-centred planning and budgeting helped ensure the continuity of education for 400 out-of-school children, and almost 1,500 children at risk of dropping out of school. The UN also supported more than 45,600 students, including 2887 children of refugees and asylum seekers with equipment to facilitate home-based learning. <br><br>
                        In Indonesia, like in other countries, violent extremist groups   sought to capitalise on pandemic-induced social isolation and economic adversity to spread divisive narratives and disinformation. This required an evolving and inclusive human security-based strategy on the prevention of violent extremism (PVE.) <br><br>

                        Since 2017, the UN has worked closely with the Wahid Foundation to empower   women   to   build   peaceful and   resilient   communities   and   support   a   gender-responsive approach to conflict prevention and PVE through its Peace Villages project.  Some 17 villages, covering a   population   of   about   100,000   people, declared themselves ‘Peace Villages’ between 2017 and 2021, meaning that village stakeholders have committed to achieving   nine   indicators   of   a   peaceful   village with women’s participation and leadership.  In 2021, more than 100 Peace Village residents joined training programs—since converted to e-learning tools—that focus on preventing violent extremism, implementing gender   equality, and   increasing   access   to   justice. The UN and Wahid Foundation’s Peace Village action plan draws support from the Ministry of Villages, provincial and local governments, and stakeholders including village heads, local religious leaders, and faith-based organisations.  <br><br>
                        The UN also supports Indonesia’s National Action Plan on PVE through The Guyub Project—which means “togetherness” in Javanese—and several other programmes that operate out of The Peace Hub, a unique physical an online platform that brings together UN agencies, government, national security agencies and civil society on counterterrorism and PVE. The affiliated programmes, Guyub, Convey, and Protect, reached more than 13 million people to promote human security-based approaches to PVE. <br><br>
                        In late 2020, Indonesia became one of 16 country champions of the UN’s Global Compact on Migration (GCM).  In accordance with the GCM’s values, the UN continued   to   advance   a   whole-of-government and   whole-of-society   approach   to   migration   in 2021, promoting   policies   that   support   Indonesia’s commitment to protecting the rights of migrants. <br><br>
                        Through its Safe and Fair Migration Joint Programme (SAF), for example, the UN collaborated with five women crisis centres to support victims of violence against women and trafficking, including women migrant workers and their families.  The programme 
                        mobilised community-level stakeholders to prevent and   respond   to   violence   against   women   through improved    case    monitoring, caseworker    training, referrals, and    information    sharing.    Through    this intervention, some 5,000 migrant workers and them 
                        families—including    about    3,000    women—received training and information on recruitment agencies, labour rights, women’s rights, safe migration procedures, and financial literacy. A further 292 migrant workers who had been victims of violence received psychosocial 
                        support and referrals to essential services. <br><br>
                        Refugees were inordinately impacted by the pandemic but UN support services, including community accommodation, cash-based interventions for basic needs, health care, mental health and psychosocial support, and education for children and adults reached 7,500 refugees and asylum seekers. UN advocacy also helped make it easier for refugees to access COVID-19 vaccinations. <br><br>

                            As an industry whose workforce is 80% female, the plight of indonesia's garment factory workers is just one example of the disproportionate impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on women and girls. In response,
                            UN women teamed up with Jakarta-based NGO Yayasan Care Peduli to launch a gender-responsive cash-for-work programme, targeted at Sukabumi's struggling garment workers. For three months from January 2021,
                            the programme provided about 1.2 million Indonesian Rupiah each for 610 acutely vulnerable women, while they received training in cloth mask production and entrepreneurship skills. it also engaged the women's
                            male partners in training to promote more equitable relationship within households. <br><br>
                            "The cash for-work programme has opened an opportunity for me to generate new  income" Eni said. Another participant, Icoh said that as well as teaching her new skills, the scheme had connected her with a support
                            network of women facing similiar challenges. "The income the i receive will be used to cover my daily needs and some of it will be put away for savings." she said. "I plan to join a coorporative and hope to start
                            my own sewing business someday."

                            <span class="text-submodal-story">Indonesian Dai'yahs Help Protect Girls from Gender-Based Violence</span><br><br>
                            As a teacher at an Islamic junior high school, 45-year-old Nia Qolbunia is responsible for the welfare of the hundreds of female students under her care in West Java. But the scope and impact of her work expands beyond religious teaching. Women religious leaders known as Dai’yah also serve as trusted pre-marriage counselors, family planning advisors, and in many cases champions of women’s sexual and reproductive rights. <br><br>
                            Nia is one of many Dai’yah to join a training programme co-organized by UNFPA and two Muslim organizations in Indonesia designed to bolster their skills in caring for women and girls during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through 2020 and 2021, restrictions on movement curtailed women’s access to sexual and reproductive health services and exposed them to higher risks of gender-based violence, unintended pregnancies, and harmful practices like female genital mutilation and child marriage. “A lot of husbands stay at or work from home. As a result, there have been a lot of unplanned pregnancies,” Nia says. “Many parents have also married off their teenage children. There is online gender-based violence and domestic violence too.” <br><br>
                            Nia’s activities at the school now include instruction on the importance of family planning and encouraging girls to postpone marriage until they are at least 21 years old. Her school assists in the provision of contraceptive services, in collaboration with the Government, to ensure young women’s ability to continue their education or pursue employment opportunities are not compromised. “I want to fight for the rights of women and children, especially in reproductive health and education for women, to make gender equality a reality in the family and the society,” she says. <br>

                            <span class="text-submodal-story">A Papuan Influencer challenges Stigma Around Menstruation</span><br><br>
                            Jeni Karay, a popular Papuan social media influencer, still remembers how cultural taboos made it impossible for her to seek support when she first got her period in junior high school. “I couldn’t talk about it with my parents. I felt menstruation was a shameful thing to talk about, even with my friends and family,” she recalls. <br><br>
                            It is an all-too common situation. A 2017 Health and Demographic Survey found that one-in-five girls never talk about the topic of menstruation before they get their first period. This rate is higher in rural areas, including in eastern parts of Indonesia like Papua. In a UNICEF U-Report poll of over 5,800 female respondents between April and May 2020, one in six girls and women said they experienced some difficulty handling their menstruation during the pandemic. <br><br>
                            That is why UNICEF developed Oky, a period tracker application for mobile phones that allows adolescent girls to track how their period affects their body and mood so they can better understand their own body and stay healthy and happy. <br><br>
                            Impressed with Oky, Jeni began to promote it to her followers on social media and encouraged young people in Papua, including boys, to download the app. “Having Oky in the hands of Papuan girls will give them access to a trustworthy source of information on menstruation,” she said. “Giving trustworthy information to Papuan girls is part of my personal mission to empower them.” <br>

                            <span class="text-submodal-story">Women's Empowerment Aids Peaceful Elections in East Java</span><br><br>
                            Community activist Hasanah was already leading women’s economic empowerment training courses under the UN Women-supported “Peace Village” initiative when election season came around in Guluk-Guluk village. Located on Indonesia’s Madura Island, Guluk-Guluk has developed a reputation for conflict erupting around local politics, and Hasanah knew the upcoming ballot could be a flashpoint. <br><br>
                            Drawing on skills she had learned as a community trainer, Hasanah mobilized her Peace Village Working Group to de-escalate the rising tensions in the run-up to the election. Her group—60% of whom are women—convened several discussions between competing candidates and their supporters. Those meetings eventually led to all parties signing an agreement promising to adhere to peaceful behavior during the election. They kept their promise: Guluk-Guluk’s ballot proceeded peacefully—and all parties accepted its result without dispute. <br><br>
                            Through participating in the Peace Village programme, Hasanah says, “I learned how to better resolve conflict and how to focus on building peace and harmony between people in my community.” <br>

                            <span class="text-submodal-story">Supporting Community Advocates Against Female Genital Mutilation</span><br><br>
                            Helwana was seven when her mother organized a female genital mutilation (FGM) ritual for her, at her extended family’s insistence. “The paradji (a traditional birth attendant) used a piece of sharpened bamboo stick. I was screaming in severe pain, and I saw blood coming out. I was and still am very traumatized,” she says.<br><br>

                            So traumatic was the ritual that Helwana’s family spared her younger sisters from going through it. Today, as an ulama or religious leader from the Indonesian Mosque Council, Helwana endeavors to spare more women and girls from FGM. Her outreach to encourage communities to abandon the practice includes challenging groundless beliefs, such as that FGM purifies girls or controls their sexual appetite.<br><br>

                            Since 2018, UNFPA’s joint initiative with UNICEF, the Better Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights for All in Indonesia (BERANI) project has supported Indonesia’s Ministry of Health in sharing information, education and communication materials that raise awareness of the fact that FGM or cutting is a violation of women’s reproductive rights and a form of violence. The project also supports the Ministry of Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection in developing advocacy strategies that use a family-based-approach to target religious leaders, youth, and civil society organizations.<br><br>

                            Changing mindsets on the ground, community-by-community, can be painstaking work. But the BERANI project ensures Helwana and other champions of women’s rights have the institutional support they need.<br><br>
