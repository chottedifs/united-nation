                        On October 29, 2021, the day COP26 kicked off in Glasgow, Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo issued a Presidential Regulation setting out the country’s framework for action on climate change and stipulating policies for the preparation of mitigation activities to reduce carbon emissions. <br><br>
                        ​​The declining rate of deforestation in Indonesia serves as proof of the success of the government’s recent forest management    initiatives, including    a    2019 moratorium   that   tightened   the   implementation   of laws on illegal logging and other damaging activities. As a result, Indonesia’s annual deforestation rate has fallen for four consecutive years, to 119,100 hectares in 2020. The country is now on track to meet one requirement of the Nationally Determined Contributions which targets a 29% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  Through the UN’s KALFOR Project, the UN is helping to conserve an additional 44,490 Ha of land through non-forest area protection governance, which entails the mitigation of 16,138,427.17 tons of CO2e emissions. <br><br>
                        The   Ministry   of   Environment   and   Forestry (MoEF) and   the   UN   have   also   been   working together to advance the haze-free and sustainable peatland management agenda in Indonesia for over a decade—in part funded by the Global Environment Fund (GEF).  Another UN–MoEF    peatland-focused    partnership   facilitated the installation of two peatland hydrology units that cover about 5% of Indonesia’s total peatland in 2021. The hydrology units are responsible for saving almost 20 million tCO2e of greenhouse gas emissions. Their capacity to make water available for agriculture and render peatland less vulnerable to degradation and fires benefitted 7,326 people directly and a further 22,000 indirectly. <br><br>

                        The blistering pace of economic development over the past decade has lifted millions of people out of poverty in Indonesia, but it has also increased demand for energy. Today, some 30 million people lack adequate access to electricity.  If Indonesia is to deliver on phasing out coal-fired power stations, it urgently needs more clean energy and more efficient ways to make use of its generation mix. <br><br>
                        A UN project called ADLIGHT is helping Indonesia transition to more energy-efficient lighting technologies, a process that could end up saving up to 250,000 tons of CO2 eq in greenhouse gas emissions. Another    project    that    focuses    on    transforming Indonesia’s energy sector, called MTRE3, contributed to more than half a million people living in rural areas being able to access electricity generated from renewable energy sources by the end of 2021. <br><br>
                        Situated along the Pacific Rim of Fire, Indonesia is one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. In 2021, some 3,034 disasters impacted 8.3 million people, according to Indonesia’s National Disaster Mitigation Agency.  Like COVID-19, disasters set back the 2030 Agenda and exacerbate pre-existing inequalities. <br><br>
                        UN interventions throughout 2021 enhanced cross-sector coordination between government and local civil society organizations to prepare for and respond to disasters.  That included the establishment of new provincial logistic clusters in Central Java and South Sulawesi. The UN also implemented disaster risk reduction strategies for six villages, that centre on 12 tsunami-ready indicators and ran capacity building seminars for 1,303 health practitioners and government officials on how to ensure the availability of contraceptives during crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>

                        The speed at which COVID-19’s Delta variant tore through Indonesia in summer 2021 and the emergence of the Omicron variant in December underscores the need for continued vigilance to halt the spread of the pandemic.  But scientists are clear COVID-19 will not be the last   pandemic   the   world   faces—and   governments must build on the lessons of 2020 to ensure they are prepared for the next outbreak. In 2021, the UN collaborated with the Ministry of Health in 2021 on the development of a training module to strengthen public   health   emergency   preparedness   capacities at hospitals and community health centres, and to mitigate the risk of the emergence or re-emergence of   high-threat   pathogens.  This   included   extensive support of the Ministry of Health’s contact tracing capacity, including on-the-job training for staff across 19 provinces on the use of a digital tracing application that resulted in 35,000 people being registered as contact tracers. The UN also supported the establishment of a zoonosis information system for the Ministry of Health, covering priority zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza, leptospirosis, rabies, anthrax, and Nipah virus. <br><br>
                        Rapid industrial development and population growth have put Indonesia’s incredible biodiversity at risk, but the UN is working with the Government to ensure that raising living standards for Indonesia’s human population does not come at the expense of the more than 300,000 wildlife species that also call the archipelago home. <br><br>
                        A UN project to combat the illegal trade in endangered species led to the development of Indonesia’s first-ever national strategy to combat illegal wildlife trafficking in 2021, which is now awaiting legalization. In     2021, Indonesia     successfully     initiated     the implementation   of   four   new UNESCO-designated sites—all based on the principles of integrated land and   seascape   planning. <br><br>

                          <span class="text-submodal-story">Bringing Clean Reliable Power to Island Village</span><br><br>
                          As a child growing up in rural Indonesia, environmentalist Ristifah only had electricity for three hours each day. With limits on when she could charge her phones and access the internet, she often studied by candlelight and felt cut off from developments happening across the rest of the country. <br><br>
          
                          Now 29, Ristifah is working to connect Indonesians living on remote islands with clean reliable power sources. As one of 23 “Energy Patriots” recruited by Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources with UNDP support, Ristifah will spend a year living in a coastal fishing village in Muna, southeastern Sulawesi. There, she will assist the community in setting up local solar energy generation projects, including determining electricity tariffs, liaising with contractors, and recruiting operators and technicians. Like most island villages, Muna is heavily dependent on fuel-fired generators for its electricity. Such generators are often inadequate for communities’ needs, and the toxic fumes they spew that can harm the environment and cause health issues including respiratory illnesses and cancer. <br><br>
          
                          Ristifah’s assignment will require her to relocate to Muna from her home in Java 1,500 kilometers away. She says that the chance to make a difference in the lives of her compatriots makes that sacrifice worthwhile. “I hope to inspire more girls to achieve higher education,” Ristifah says. “I dream of the day when the houses sparkle with lights that the community installed, and children can have a better future.”<br><br>

                            <span class="text-submodal-story">How Coordination Built Resilience in a Flood-Hit Community</span><br><br>
                            Indah Putri Indriani, the Regent of North Luwu in South Sulawesi province was cooking in a public kitchen when her phone started buzzing with alerts informing her that flash floods in the area had forced 14,000 people from their homes. As regent, it fell on Indah to coordinate response, recovery, and reconstruction efforts in an environment already complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>
            
                            As of 30 April 2021, some 600 people in North Luwu were still in temporary shelters after the July 2020 flash floods, which stripped many residents of their incomes as well as their homes. But the impact would have been much more devastating had Indah and her colleagues at North Luwu regency not established two local task forces to manage the disaster response. Through their efforts, North Luwu engaged with regional and national governments, civil society, the private sector, and the international community. That included IOM, whose Displacement Tracking Matrix assessment tool helped monitor displacement and population movements to ensure people affected by the flood were able to receive help. IOM is also supporting Indah and her colleagues with camp coordination and management and provided training in basic entrepreneurship skills to 30 women at the temporary shelter, including helping them create sustainable business plans. <br><br>
            
                            “Being a strong and great leader has nothing to do with gender,” said Indah. “Both men and women can be one when there are no barriers from cultural values, religious beliefs, and social assumptions.” <br><br>

                            <span class="text-submodal-story">Fighting Disinformation, One Story at a Time</span><br><br>
                            Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, an ‘infodemic’ of false and misleading information has spread alongside the disease. Claims that wearing masks inhibits breathing and that the COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips have been amplified on digital platforms, undermining prevention, and vaccination efforts to devastating effect in Indonesia, where a government-backed 2020 survey found that between 64% and 79% of respondents could not recognize misinformation online. <br><br>
            
                            “Once [people] fall for fake news or hoaxes, especially religious and political, it’s not easy to change their minds,” says Renanda Putri, a third-year communications student studying media literacy and education. “They might become more intolerant, turn against the truth and science, and may be driven to conflict.” <br><br>
            
                            Renanda is one of hundreds of young Indonesians pushing back against infodemic. She volunteers as an online fact-checker at MAFINDO, an organization fighting fake that has collaborated with UNICEF in Indonesia to create a hoax buster section on the National Agency for Disaster Management’s official COVID-19 website. Just one of several UNICEF-backed initiatives to fight misinformation, the website has published more than 1,300 hoax busting articles, several of them written by Renanda. <br><br>
            
                            “People can understand which is fake news or not on the internet through education, specifically media literacy,” Renanda says. “So that’s why I want to contribute, to educate people in Indonesia on how to counter the fake news that is spreading everywhere.” <br><br>
